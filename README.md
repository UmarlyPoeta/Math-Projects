# Mathematical Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Mathematical Algorithms Repository! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts implementing various mathematical algorithms and functions. Each script focuses on a specific algorithm, providing a clear and concise implementation. Below, you will find a brief description of each file included in this repository.

## Files and Descriptions

### Peasant_multiplication.py
A Python script implementing the ancient Peasant Multiplication algorithm, also known as Russian Multiplication. This algorithm multiplies two numbers using a series of halving and doubling operations.

### armstrong_number.py
This script checks if a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

### det_matrix.py
A Python script for calculating the determinant of a matrix. This implementation provides a way to determine if a matrix is singular or non-singular by computing its determinant.

### egyptian_division.py
This script implements the Egyptian Division algorithm, which is an ancient method of division using repeated subtraction and halving.

### egyptian_multiplication.py
A Python script for performing multiplication using the Egyptian Multiplication method. Similar to Peasant Multiplication, it uses doubling and addition to compute the product.

### palindrome.py
This script checks whether a given string or number is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same backward as forward.

### gcd_lcm.py
A Python script to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The script uses the Euclidean algorithm for GCD and the relationship between GCD and LCM to find the LCM.

### perfect_square.py
This script determines if a given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer.

### prime_factors.py
A Python script for finding all prime factors of a given number. The script breaks down the number into its prime components.

### sieve_of_eratosthenes.py
This script implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a specified limit. The algorithm is efficient and commonly used for generating lists of primes.

### triangular_number.py
A Python script to determine if a given number is a triangular number. Triangular numbers are those that can form an equilateral triangle. This script also calculates the n-th triangular number.

### vector_rotation.py
This script performs vector rotation in a 2D plane. Given a vector and an angle, it computes the new coordinates of the vector after rotation by the specified angle.

## Getting Started

To run any of these scripts, you will need Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the script you wish to execute. Use the following command to run a script:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to run.
